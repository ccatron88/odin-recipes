This project is a simple recipe website with a couple of pages
to hop around. There are 3 total recipe pages and one home page.

Each page has a list of links to the other pages.

This project was meant to highlight the abilty to write in HTML.
Specifically the ability to use image <img>, anchor <a>, and 
list <ul>,<ol>,<li> tags/elements. A few additional elements/tags 
were used, such as the <div> element, and style attribute.
